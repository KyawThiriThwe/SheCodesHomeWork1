        <strong>
            Thingyan
        </strong>
        is the <em>Burmese New Year Festival</em> that usually occurs in middle of April. Thingyan is the first ever
        water festival celebrated in the world or the earliest water festival in water festivals.Thingyan has been
        celebrated since the semi-legendary Tagaung period(1st-2nd century AD) of Myanmar and became
        widespread during the Bagan period (10-12th century AD). It is a Buddhist festival celebrated over a period of
        four to
        five days, culminating in the New Year. The dates of the Thingyan Festival are calculated according to the
        Burmese
        calendar.
        </br>The dates of the festival are observed as public holidays throughout Myanmar, and are part of the
        summer holidays at the
        end of the school year. Water-throwing or dousing one another from any shape or form of vessel or device that
        delivers
        water is the distinguishing feature of this festival and may be done on the first four days of the festival. The
        New
        Year takes place at virtually the same time as the new year celebrations of many countries in South Asia like
        China (Dai
        People of Yunnan Province), Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.
